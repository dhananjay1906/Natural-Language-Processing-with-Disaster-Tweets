# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets


## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing tweets related to disasters. Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques, we aim to classify tweets into two categories: those referring to actual disasters and those that do not. This project serves as a valuable resource for disaster management, information retrieval, and understanding public sentiment during emergencies.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing and cleaning of tweet data
- Implementation of various NLP models and techniques
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Visualizations to gain insights from the data

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and several libraries. We recommend setting up a virtual environment.
